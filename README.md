# FYP-ImageGenie

## This project is developed for my final year project

## Introduction
In today's digital age, images play a crucial role in communication and self-expression. People take and share hundreds of photos every day on various social media platforms, and the demand for image enhancement tools has never been higher. However, many existing image processing applications often require advanced technical knowledge to use. While traditional image processing applications offer basic image enhancement capabilities, they fall short when it comes to providing a comprehensive solution for image enhancement. There is a need for an application that combines multiple image enhancement tasks in a single, user-friendly platform. This is where ImageGenie comes in. The goal of ImageGenie is to provide a comprehensive solution for image using deep learning techniques. The project has the following objectives which are increase the resolution of low quality images, provide users with the ability to cartoonify their images, allow users to perform neural style transfer that can compose one image in the style of another image and enable users to turn their text into images using Stable Diffusion. ImageGenie will use deep learning algorithms to provide a comprehensive solution for image enhancement. With its user-friendly interface, ImageGenie will allow users to perform multiple image enhancement tasks with ease. The expected outcome of the project is a powerful, all-in-one tool for image enhancement that will revolutionize the way people work with their digital images. By providing a comprehensive solution for image enhancement, ImageGenie will allow people to take their digital images to the next level, making it easier than ever to create and share high-quality, visually appealing content.
